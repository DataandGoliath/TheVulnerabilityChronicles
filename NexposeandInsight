Nexpose and Insight

Nexpose is Rapid7's vulnerability scanner. InsightVM (Vulnerability Managment) is Nexpose's evolution. Both require a 64bit machine. 

My flashdrive is 32 bit. It was an intentional descision to allow me to boot on any machine. 
But that means that both scanners are offline. Also, Nexpose is no longer available for download. I was able to track down an archive, and it too required a 64x machine.
Damn you Rapid7. I love your stuff but come on. Get your 86x together.
