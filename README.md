# TheVulnerabilityChronicles
The story of my trial and (repeated) error process of getting OpenVAS 8.0 to run on Kali Linux 2017. Included is my struggle to get any OTHER scanner on, including Nessus, Nexpose, and InsightVM, among others. I'm looking for network scanners, not web scanners, the difference being network scanners let me scan a computer for vulnerabilities instead of scanning it's web server. Much more versitile, much more powerful, much more rare. And remember, I'm doing this, so you don't have to.
